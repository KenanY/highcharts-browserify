This is an OPEN Open Source Project
Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.

Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

No --force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way.
External API changes and significant modifications should be subject to a pull request to solicit feedback from other contributors.
Pull requests to solicit feedback are encouraged for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
Use a non-master branch for ongoing work.
Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
Run npm test locally before submitting your PR to catch easy-to-miss style & testing issues
Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document is subject to pull requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.

Thanks to Rod Vagg and the LevelUP project for coming up with this model of open source contribution.
